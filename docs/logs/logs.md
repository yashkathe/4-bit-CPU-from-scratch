# 11052025

asked chat gpt for a roadmap:

üß† Phase 1: Foundations

1. Digital Logic Basics
   Learn about: Logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR), truth tables, Boolean algebra

Build in simulator: All basic gates using only transistors (PMOS, NMOS)

2. Combinational Circuits
   Learn about: Adders, multiplexers, encoders, decoders

Build:

Half adder ‚Üí full adder

4-bit ripple carry adder

Multiplexer (MUX) and Demux

Priority encoder / Decoder

3. Sequential Circuits
   Learn about: Flip-flops (SR, D, JK), latches, clocks

Build:

D flip-flop using gates ‚Üí using transistors

Registers (8-bit)

Counters (binary, up/down)

‚öôÔ∏è Phase 2: Building Blocks of CPU 4. Memory
Learn about: SRAM cells, register files, basic RAM

Build:

1-bit memory cell

8x8 RAM

Instruction Register (IR)

5. ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)
   Include operations: ADD, SUB, AND, OR, NOT, XOR, maybe CMP

Build:

ALU with opcode control

Flag outputs: Zero, Carry, Negative

6. Control Unit
   Learn about: FSM (Finite State Machines), instruction decoding

Build:

Microprogrammed or hardwired control logic

Instruction set design (start simple: MOV, ADD, JMP)

üîó Phase 3: Integration 7. Buses and Data Path
Learn about: Tri-state logic, buses, data flow control

Build:

Data bus and address bus

Control signals for register read/write, ALU operation

8. Program Counter and Branching
   Implement:

Program Counter (PC)

Instruction memory fetch

JMP/JZ instructions

üíª Phase 4: Final CPU 9. Basic CPU Architecture
Combine everything: ALU, registers, control unit, buses, memory

Build a simple CPU that can:

Fetch ‚Üí Decode ‚Üí Execute

Handle basic assembly-like instructions

10. Sample Programs
    Write programs in your simple instruction set

Run them to test (e.g., add two numbers, loop, conditional jumps)
